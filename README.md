# Boostrap-4-Starter
My custom Bootstrap / Gulp starter

### This is a starter repository for projects using Boostrap 4 with Sass and BrowserSync.

This starter uses Gulp v4 to run tasks. In order for it to work, gulp-cli must be installed. Make sure it is by running **npm install -g gulp-cli**

Then you can run **npm install**, followed by **npm start** to get up and running on port 3000
